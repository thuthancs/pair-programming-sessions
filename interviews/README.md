- `func.length`: `length` data property of a Function instance indicates the number of parameters _expected_ by the function.
- `reduce()`: returns a single output by applying the same callback function on each element of the array.
- JS is single-threaded and blocking the main thread is not a good idea.
- JS is confusing and always remember the semicolon
