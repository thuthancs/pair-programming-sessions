# Build An Accordion

Build an Accordion component that displays a list of vertically stacked sections that each contain a title and content snippet. Some HTML is provided for you as example contents along with a chevron icon.

## Requirements

- [x] By default, all sections are collapsed and are hidden from view.
- [x] Clicking on a section title toggles the contents.
- [x] If the section is collapsed, the section will be expanded and the contents will be displayed.
- [x] If the section is expanded, the section will be collapsed and the contents will be hidden.
- [x] The sections are independent of each other.

## Key Takeaways

- This project helped me review the `map()` built-in method, which is used when you want to apply changes to each item in an array and return a completely new array. This is particularly useful when we want to make changes to a particular property of an object.
- Also, I got more comfortable writing a `map()` function to return HTML elements in the return statement.
