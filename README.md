# Pair Programming Sessions

This repo consists of frontend programming interview questions from [GreatFrontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions). All attempted solutions are completed with minimal assistance from AI, primarily for the purposes of spaced repetition and deliberate practice.

## Plain JS

| Feature | Requirement(s) | Takeaways |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Counter | Make the text within the button display the number of times the button has been clicked. | Did not use AI at all for this feature. Got reminded that `text-align: center` is used to center text or div horizontally. When in doubt, `console.log()`
| Accordion | Build an Accordion component that displays a list of vertically stacked sections that each contain a title and content snippet. By default, all sections are collapsed and are hidden from view. Clicking on a section title toggles the contents. If the section is collapsed, the section will be expanded and the contents will be displayed. If the section is expanded, the section will be collapsed and the contents will be hidden. The sections are independent of each other. | Did not use AI for this feature. The current approach is a bit repetitive because I define 3 separate functions for 3 sections using the same logic. This is not scalable because what if there are more than 3 sections (think a Q&A). I'm thinking one way I can improve this is to define only one function using an `if-else` logic such that if the button clicked is A, then change the content of A, but if the button is B, then change the content of B, etc.
| Contact Form | The form should contain the following elements: Name field, Email field, Message field. Since the message can be long, a textarea will be more suitable. Submit button contains the text "Send" and clicking on the submit button submits the form. The form and submission should be implemented entirely in HTML. Do not use any JavaScript or framework-specific features for this question. There is no need to do any client-side validation on the fields. Validation will be done on the server side.| Learned that I could use the attributes `action` to define the URL and `method` to define the HTTP method to submit the form without JS script|
| Flight Booker | The user can choose from two flight options: "One-way flight" and "Round-trip flight". The date input fields represent the departure date and return dates, with the return date input displayed only if the "Round-trip flight" option is chosen and hidden otherwise. Form validation should be done upon submission for invalid fields, including dates that are in the past and return dates that are before the departure date. Upon successful submission, a message is displayed informing the user of their selection: for a one-way flight, the message reads "You have booked a one-way flight on YYYY-MM-DD", while for a round-trip flight it reads "You have booked a round-trip flight, departing on YYYY-MM-DD and returning on YYYY-MM-DD". | Learned that to assign a value like a number or string to a span, I need to use `.textContent` and to set the date to today I can do `new Date()`|
| Generate Table | The user enters the number of rows and columns in a form. When the form is submitted, a table with the respective number of rows and columns will be generated. The table contains rows x columns cells, each containing a number sequence from 1 to (rows x columns).| If I want to define the grid-template-columns, I have to use `.style.gridTemplateColumns`|
